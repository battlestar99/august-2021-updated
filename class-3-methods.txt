java - 

1. java structure - setup 
2. datatype, variables and data 
3. conditional statement ( if, else, else if) 
4. looping , array - we will discuss later 
5. java method - library
6. OOP - object oriented programming - discuss later 

java method - 

main method - class with a main method 
we can run the class - 
runnable class - 

non-runnable class - without a main method 

traditional programming concept - 
to create re-usuable methods - 
to create re-usuale java code 

object oriented programming concept 

method1{
write some code 

}

outline of what we need to learn: 

1. how to create java method 

accessModifier returntype nameofthemethod(parameters) 
{

return returntype; 
}

2. how to use the java method 

1. you have to create an object of the class where the
method is located 
object - a copy of the class 


3. how to use the java method from java library 


how to create a java method >> 

public static void main(String args[]){

// all the codes are inside the main method 

}

creating a general method 

public >> access modifier 
return type >> data type 
name the method >> identifier , verb for creating method 

public int addtwonumbers(parameters){

return 12; 
}

// creating a method - non runnable class

public boolean ifeligiableforloan(int creditscore, int income){

boolean flag; 

if (crediscore>700 && income>50000){


}


}















getText

String 

String webpagevalue = driver.gettext();

20 methods - 

gettext >> you need to find out from which is class the 
method is coming

programming library - 

non-runnable classes >> methods 

1000 classes >> 5000 methods 

documentation of the programming >> 

3rd party library - 

variables - 

object - reference variable 

// two steps 

1. main method >> runnable class 

public static void main (String args[]){
 
// instuctions or code for computer 
}

traditional way - 

2. class without main method >> non-runnable 
method / function 
convertiong celsius to farenhite 

non-runnable class - design a system
or create prototype of a system 

java class - prototype - design 

car >> 

what the car can do - function - acceleate, move forward, backward
what the car has - door, color, engine

design a class >> prototype 

what the class can do >> functions 
what attribute the class >> properties  

object - 

static >> is part of the class and not part of any object

static >> you don't need to create object 
non-static >> you need to create multiple object 

library - selenium - 3rd party programming library 

this library has all the functions to interact with a 
web browser 

selenium library >> jar file 

non - runnbale class >> there are function

webdriver - get, gettext, navigate
webelement - click, sendkeys
select - selectbyvisisbaletest, 

1. we need jar files >> 

2. we need to have driver file - chrome browser
chromedriver file

92 - google chrome browser version 





1. we need to be able to use the selenium library 
functions - 20 functions from 3/4 different 



opening a browser
navigating to a url 
clicking on any webelement 

every object represents one browser instance in 
webdriver class
