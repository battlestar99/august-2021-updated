computer programming : 

step by step instructions to the computer

compiler : covert programming lanuag to binary(machine language) 


1. structure of java 

java project >> just a folder that comes with jre system library

package - is a java folder 

java class - is the basic unit of java 

a class that you can run - main method of java 
a class that can not run - doesn't have the main method of java

scope - class, methods, conditional statments, looping
statement - ends with ; 

java is a case sensitive programming lanague 

A a 


2. how to store data in a program

problem solve - 
money, address, ssn, firstname, lastname

whole number >> 12 , 100 >> integer 
name, address >> String 
double, float >> 12.10
boolean >> true and false 

int 
String 
boolean 

100 >> 
data type: java has certain data type
variable >> memory space 

int x = 100;

int y = 200; 

String name="john";

double z = 10.20; 

x is an integer type of variable and the value of x is 100 

two step process: 

step 1: declaring variable
int number;

Step 2: initializa the variable with a value

number=23;

2 steps together
int number=23;

identifier >> 

datatype : int , String, double, boolean

datatype name_of_variable = value_of_variable ; 

int x = 299;

String name = "michael";

double y = 10.23;

boolean abc = true; 

2 steps process 

1. declare a variable
2. initialize the variable with a value



3. conditional statment 
4. looping statement 
5. array - 
6. methods/function 


7. object oriented programming ( OOP) 

two things you need to do 

1. practice >> by doing homework
2. questions >> write the answers
