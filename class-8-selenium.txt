class is a design or prototype of a system/software
class car{

// properties the car will have 
int mileage; 
String vinNumber; 
String ownername; 

// what car can do

public void start(){}
public void run(){}



}


car a = new car()
car b = new car()
class is a design or prototype: 

properties - global variable
can do - methods 

Test scripts >> 
Test case >> steps/actions

20 webelements >> locations are not working/
id for all 20 web elements 
40 
20 weblements again
50 different test scripts >> 

300 steps >> 

1000 steps>> 

two types of automation testing framework
1. object driven>> when we seperate the webelements
from the test scripts we can call it object driven frameowrk 
2. data driven >> when we seperate the test data from 
test scripts 
xml file
excel file
database file 

hybrid framework 

web element/object driven frameowork >> 

we can create non-runnable class to store all the weblement in functions, so whenever we need them
we can call them and use them

page object model class >> non-runnable class

Steps of creating page object model: 

1. create page object model class for each webpage in your system
2. create a constructor to enforce to use the same driver in test scripts and page object model class
3. creating one function for each web element 

10 web pages >> you should have 10 page object model class

50 webelements 8 different page object 

500 different steps 

requirements 

10 requirements >> 30 test scenarios 

30 test case
30 test scripts 



page object models are already created 

inventory: 

how many method/functions you should have?

depends on how many weblements 

why do you create page object model? 
how do you create page object model?
